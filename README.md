# Simple Chat Application
This is a simple chat application made with MongoDB, ReactJS, Express, and Node. Feel free to submit your own code and help build this thing up :), the plan is to shift this into a "Cards Against Humanity" type game.

#Play with it
You can play with this application at https://multiplayer-word-game.herokuapp.com/
